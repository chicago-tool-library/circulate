Hello <%= preferred_or_default_name(@member) %>,

As the end of your first (extended) year of tool library membership approaches, we hope you were able to accomplish great things as a library member.  How has it felt to be one of the founding members and knowing you have access to these tools and this community? Are you ready to renew your membership so you can keep borrowing for another year of repair, learning, and exploration?.

Membership fees are the Chicago Tool Library’s #1 source of income and the <%= @amount.format(no_cents: true) %> you contributed last year helped your community tool library accomplish so much in 2020:

* We added 676 tools to our inventory that now houses 1,286 unique tools!
* We welcomed 498 new library members!
* We developed new software features like member logins and appointment scheduling.

This year we’re encouraging our library members who can afford to do so to give a little more.  If all of our members gave an extra:

$10: we would be able to buy expensive in-demand tools like a floor sander, more nail guns, or a rug doctor.
$25: we would be able to hire a part-time staff-member and expand our hours from 10 hours to 20+ hours/week.
$50: we would be able to launch innovative new programs like tool delivery and pick-up services.

If you’re ready to renew your membership, login to your member profile here: <%= account_home_url %>. As always, we don’t turn anyone away for an inability to pay.

If you no longer need a membership but you’d like to keep supporting the Tool Library; you can still donate here: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=9G7F4GRKDBRAC&source=url

Every dollar will go directly to improving this shared space for all Chicagoans. If you’d like to deactivate your membership please let us know.

Also, look out for a forthcoming survey about the Tool Library to make sure your voice is heard.  After all, the Chicago Tool Library is about YOU!

Thank you for participating in this amazing experiment with us!
