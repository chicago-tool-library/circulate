Hi there!

We've assigned your account a temporary password of: <%= @new_password %>

You should be able to use your email and that password to sign in here: <%= new_user_session_url %>

You can then reset your password to one only you know on this page: <%= edit_account_password_url %>

(That page is also available by clicking "Membership" at the top and then the "Edit Password" button at the top right.)
