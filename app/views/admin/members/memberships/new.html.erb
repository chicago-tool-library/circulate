  <p class="main">Memberships provide one year of borrowing privileges.</p>
  <p class="sub">The Chicago Tool Library's main source of funding is membership fees. It's important to us that you pay what you want for your year of tool access. Pay more if you can, pay less if you can't - no questions asked. Your payment will go directly towards funding the tools and materials needed to make the Tool Library the magical place that it is.</p>
    <p>Our recommendation is that folks pay $1 for every $1,000 of income they make in a year.<br>For example, if a person makes $40,000 each year, we recommend their membership fee be $40.</p>
