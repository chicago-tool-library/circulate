<h1>Member Verification</h1>
<div class="instructions">
  <p class="main">Members must present the following to activate their membership:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Proof of address</strong><br>This needs to include their name and current address in <%= current_library.city %>. Utility bills, leases, and other official mail work well for this.</li>
    <li><strong>A photo ID</strong>
      <br>This needs to show their name and a photo.
      <br>Good options include a state driver's license or ID card,
      a <a href="https://www.chicityclerk.com/chicagocitykey" target="blank">Chicago City Key</a>, or a job or student ID card.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="sub">Members can't checkout items until these items have been verified.</p>
