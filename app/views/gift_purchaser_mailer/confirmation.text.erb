Hello <%= @gift_membership.purchaser_name %>,

You have successfully purchased a One Year Gift Membership to the Chicago Tool Library. Go you!

Your gift code is: <%= @gift_membership.code.format %>

The recipient of this gift membership needs to use this code to complete the membership sign-up on our website or in-person at the Tool Library.

After completing their sign-up, they will need to bring the following into the library:

* Proof of their address
  This needs to include their name and current address in Chicago. Utility bills, leases, and other official mail work well.

* A photo ID
  This needs to show their name and a photo and can be from the state, their job, school, etc.

Once we review the above, their one-year membership will begin on the day they borrow their first tool.

Don't hesitate to email us at team@chicagotoollibrary.org with any questions!
