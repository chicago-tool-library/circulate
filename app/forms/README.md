# Forms

Forms are Ruby objects that facilitate representing specific processes within the constraints of the [ActiveModel API](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveModel/Model.html). Common use cases include providing a way to validate form inputs that aren't tied directly to an ActiveRecord model or representing a single interface over operations on multiple ActiveRecord models.
