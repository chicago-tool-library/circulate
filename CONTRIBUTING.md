Thanks for wanting to help out with this project! Circulate helps hundreds of people borrow all kinds of items from The Chicago Tool Library every month.

## How to submit a Pull Request

1. Look for a task that you‚Äôd like to work on in our Project. We have [a list of good tasks for new volunteers](https://github.com/orgs/chicago-tool-library/projects/1/views/8). Only the tasks with the ‚ÄúBacklog‚Äù status are ready to be worked on.
2. Please claim all tasks that you are working on. If you don‚Äôt have access to do so yet, you can comment on the issue to say you want to start working on it and someone will assign it to you.
3. Open a Pull Request on GitHub when you‚Äôre done with your work or want to get feedback on it. If you get stuck, this is a good way to share the code you have so far and get additional eyes on it.
4. Within a few days, someone else from the project will review your pull request. In general, at least one other person should look at all changes before they are merged into main. We do our best to respond quickly, but please be patient if it takes a few days for someone to review your code. We‚Äôre all here on a volunteer basis!
5. If changes are requested on your PR, go ahead and make them. If you aren‚Äôt going to be able to make any additional changes, please comment on the PR so we know that the work can be picked up by someone else üòÄ.
6. We merge your PR, and you‚Äôre done! At this point you can go back to step 2 and look for something else to work on.

## Pointers for making a great PR

1. Include the issue number (ex. `Resolves #1`) in the PR description. 
2. Please [run the tests](./README.md#running-tests) and the [linting](./README.md#code-formatting-and-linting) checks on your code and fix any issues that arise. CI will check this for you on PRs ü§ñ.
3. Check one of the boxes at the bottom of the PR template to indicate how involved you want to be in making additional changes to the code you're submitting.
